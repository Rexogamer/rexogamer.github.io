heya! welcome to my brand new site.

first, some background. my original site (source code [here](https://github.com/rexogamer/rexogamer.github.io)) was made with plain HTML and CSS, with a _tiny_ amount of JS for Plausible and a support notice. it was lightweight - and towards the end I felt it ended up looking _fine_ - but I wasn't 100% happy with it, and it certainly wasn't the nicest thing to maintain. I wasn't exactly desperate to switch to, say, React though - this site isn't exactly complex, so the performance overhead wasn't really worthwhile to me.

I'm not 1000% sure when/where I first tried Astro, but I found it very nice to use. I'd been considering using it for my site for a little while, but I put it off... until recently, when we used it for [Upryzing's landing page](https://upryzing.app/utm_source=rexo_blog_newsite). at that point I was convinced, and in late June I got started. I had hoped to finish this in time for the start of the month, but alas.

...but not to worry - it's here now! apart from the revamped design, this new site is _much_ nicer to maintain, adapts considerably better to smaller screen sizes and has some cool new features... like this blog! I'm not _entirely_ certain what I'll use this for, but I think it'll be useful in the future.

so yeah. welcome! if you notice any issues or have any suggestions, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/rexogamer/rexogamer.github.io/issues). I hope you like it :3
